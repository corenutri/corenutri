	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Omega-3 fats are known to be heart-healthy, but they support many other functions related to physical activity, too.</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4415 size-large" src="http://www.corenutri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Omega-3-Fatty-Acids-Support-Physical-Activity-1024x679.png" alt="" width="590" height="391" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Omega-3-Fatty-Acids-Support-Physical-Activity-1024x679.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Omega-3-Fatty-Acids-Support-Physical-Activity-300x199.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Omega-3-Fatty-Acids-Support-Physical-Activity-768x509.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Omega-3-Fatty-Acids-Support-Physical-Activity.png 1150w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to diets, it’s likely that many athletes focus more on their carbohydrate and protein intake than they do on the types of fat they eat. Most know that carbs are a significant energy source for working muscles, and that protein helps repair and build muscle – so they may focus on those two macronutrients and figure that fat will just come along for the ride.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And, in a sense, that’s usually how it works. Fat is naturally present in a lot of foods that we eat, so getting enough isn’t rarely a problem. Any type of dietary fat serves as a major source of energy to the body, which is one reason why athletes are advised not to overly restrict their intake. But not all fats are created equal, and certain fats – such as the omega-3 fats obtained from seafood – support many biological processes that occur during exercise.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Omega-3 fats are polyunsaturated fats, and they’re considered essential in diets because our bodies can’t make them. There are several different omega-3 fatty acids – two, known as EPA and DHA, are derived from seafood (usually called ‘fish oils’), and these particular fatty acids have been shown to be heart-healthy. (Another omega-3 fatty acid, known as ALA, is found in nuts, seeds, vegetable oils and leafy greens, but your body cannot convert it into fish oils.) Since many people don’t consume the recommended two to three fish meals per week, they may be missing out on not only the heart-healthy benefits of these fats, but also the support they offer during physical activity.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Omega-3 fats support the health of blood vessels through which blood travels to deliver nutrients and oxygen to working muscles (including the heart muscle).</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Omega-3 fatty acids are a structural component of all cell membranes, including red blood cells. Healthy red blood cells are flexible, which allows them to move freely through blood vessels to deliver oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Omega-3 fats taken regularly help to support normal brain function and vision.</li>
</ul>

Dr. John Agwunobi, Chief Health and Nutrition Officer at Herbalife Nutrition, explains how Herbalife Formula 1 Meal Replacement shakes help support weight management in a healthy way</p>

<h1>Protein Meal Shakes</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Product Overview</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kick-start your healthy eating habits with Formula 1 Healthy Meal Nutritional Shake Mix, a delicious and easy way to treat your body to a nutritious and balanced meal in no time! With a dense mix of protein, carbs, fiber and essential vitamins and minerals, Formula 1 is everything you need in a glass, and with 10 flavors to choose from it’s easy to customize for your taste and nutritional needs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-4330" src="http://www.corenutri.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Herbalife-Formula-1-Shakes-Quality-Nutrition-294x300.png" alt="Herbalife Formula 1 Shakes - Quality Nutrition" width="294" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Herbalife-Formula-1-Shakes-Quality-Nutrition-294x300.png 294w, /wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Herbalife-Formula-1-Shakes-Quality-Nutrition.png 734w" sizes="(max-width: 294px) 100vw, 294px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Protein is vital to a healthy diet, as it’s one of the essential building blocks for many cell components in your body. Protein helps satisfy hunger, build muscle tissue, maintain lean muscle mass and give you energy. And when you consume 25 g of soy protein a day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, you may reduce the risk of heart disease. One serving of Formula 1 provides 9 g of soy protein. Clinical studies on U.S. Formula 1 (one study) and on similar products show that Formula 1 shakes taken twice a day as part of a reduced-calorie diet along with moderate exercise help people lose weight.</p>
<h2>Key Benefits</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fiber and 17 g of protein (of which 9 g are provided by soy protein, and 8 g are provided when mixed with 8 oz. of nonfat milk) help support weight management</li>
<li>21 vitamins and minerals</li>
<li>170 calories when prepared as directed</li>
<li>0 cholesterol, 0 trans fats</li>
<li>Excellent source of antioxidant Vitamins A (as beta-carotene), C and E</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Gently shake the canister prior to each use as contents may settle.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Blend or stir 2 scoops with 8 oz. of nonfat milk or soymilk and enjoy!</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Create your own Formula 1 recipes by mixing with fresh fruit and ice.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Add 2 scoops (one serving) of Protein Drink Mix to your favorite Formula 1 Healthy Meal Nutritional Shake and blend or stir with 8 oz. of water to boost your protein intake to 24 g per serving.</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Herbalife also recommends using with Formula 2 Multivitamin Complex and Formula 3 Cell Activator® to complete the Herbalife® Core Cellular Nutrition program.</li>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to stay healthy while you travel ! Are you jetting off somewhere nice this summer? You don’t have to let unhealthy habits creep in to enjoy yourself.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Simply follow fitness expert Samantha Clayton’s guide to staying fit and healthy while you travel…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4306" src="http://www.corenutri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/How-to-stay-healthy-while-you-travel-1024x672.png" alt="How to stay healthy while you travel" width="590" height="387" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/How-to-stay-healthy-while-you-travel-1024x672.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/How-to-stay-healthy-while-you-travel-300x197.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/How-to-stay-healthy-while-you-travel-768x504.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/How-to-stay-healthy-while-you-travel.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">How to stay healthy while you travel</h2>
<h2>1) ARRIVE FEELING RESTED</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Landing at your destination feeling relaxed is important if you want to be active on holiday and avoid stress, as this can often lead to unhealthy food choices. Earplugs, an eye mask, neck pillow and flight socks (to help with circulation in your legs) will make your journey more comfortable and help you feel rested and energised on arrival.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">2) PLAN TO BE ACTIVE</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can’t exercise without your gym gear so don’t forget to pack it! Workout wear is practical and lightweight, and you can wear your trainers during your journey to keep you comfortable too. Before you go, look up some good running routes or whether your hotel has a gym, and make being active part of your holiday by exploring the local area on foot or by bike.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">3) TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR FOOD</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Airport and airline food is often full of unhealthy, highcalorie ingredients so be prepared with convenient, calorie-controlled foods that can be enjoyed on the go, such as Herbalife Formula 1 Express Bars – a healthy meal replacement with fibre, protein and essential nutrients.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">4) DRINK LOTS OF WATER</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Keeping your body hydrated on the journey and throughout your holiday will help to keep your body working as it should. Remember: if you’re exercising and/or sweating in higher temperatures then you’ll need to drink even more than usual.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">5) EXPERIMENT WITH CUISINES</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">When you’re away from your everyday routine, you have time to seek out healthy food options and experiment with new foods and try the local cuisines. Get ideas on how to spice up your weekly menu at home!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">6) FOCUS ON YOURSELF</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Use your free time to rejuvenate, get extra sleep and take time for yourself. True relaxation and meditation can positively enhance your overall feeling of wellness and even boost your results.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">7) NO EXCUSES: WORKOUT ANYWHERE!</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Spending 15 minutes exercising on each day of your holiday will not only keep you on track to your goals but will make you feel better, and more able to enjoy those little indulgences. The exercises below can be done anywhere, any time, and do not require any equipment at all. Repeat the routine as many times as you can, and don’t forget to stretch before and after.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">8) CONSISTENCY</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As Samantha concludes; “The best thing you can do to ensure that you stay in shape through your holiday is to make your health a top priority, regardless of your location or schedule. Being disciplined and consistent as much as possible is what will help you to reach your goals.”</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Last year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) updated the guidelines that apply to product labels across the entire food and dietary supplement industry.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4301" src="http://www.corenutri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Changes-to-the-Nutrition-Facts-Label-925x1024.png" alt="Changes to the Nutrition Facts Label" width="590" height="653" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Changes-to-the-Nutrition-Facts-Label-925x1024.png 925w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Changes-to-the-Nutrition-Facts-Label-271x300.png 271w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Changes-to-the-Nutrition-Facts-Label-768x850.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Changes-to-the-Nutrition-Facts-Label.png 970w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The new labels are based on the latest science, and the redesigned look makes the information easier to read and understand. As a result of the new guidelines, we will be phasing in updated labels through the rest of this year and into 2018.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Because of the limited space, the new labels will be shown in English only. The Spanish information will be available on MyHerbalife.com and GoHerbalife.com on each product page.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here’s a breakdown of the FDA label changes that will soon start appearing on your favorite Herbalife® products.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Changes to the Nutrition Facts Panel</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These changes apply to food labels only.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The type size for Calories, Servings Per Container, and Serving Size is now larger</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Vitamin D and Potassium will replace Vitamins A and C as required vitamins and minerals that will need to be listed on the Nutrition Facts panel, whether they are in a product or not</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Gram amounts will now be listed for all vitamins and minerals</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Calories from Fat will no longer be listed</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Sugars will be listed as Total Sugars</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Added Sugars are now called out, and will include gram amounts and the percent of Daily Value</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Updates to the Percent of Daily Values</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This change applies to both food and dietary supplement labels.</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The Percent of Daily Value (% Daily Value) has been updated according to new scientific evidence</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Serving Size Update</h2>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Serving Size for beverages and powered drink mixes will be updated from 8 fl. oz. to 12 fl. oz.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Other Updates</h2>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">The phrase Natural flavors with other natural flavors may now appear on labels when there is more than one natural flavor in the product that contributes to the main characterizing flavor on the label.</li>
</ul>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>HERBALIFE MEAL PLANS</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Our meal plans are simple and easy! The calorie counts are built into the plans, and the plans are designed to provide you with the right amount of protein your body needs every day to function at its best.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4294" src="http://www.corenutri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Personalized-daily-Meal-Plans-1024x613.png" alt="Personalized daily Meal Plans" width="590" height="353" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Personalized-daily-Meal-Plans-1024x613.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Personalized-daily-Meal-Plans-300x180.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Personalized-daily-Meal-Plans-768x460.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Personalized-daily-Meal-Plans.png 1136w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All you need to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Select the plan that fits your needs</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Create daily menus that include Herbalife<sup style="font-weight: 300;">®</sup><span style="font-weight: 300;"> Formula 1 shakes, healthy balanced meals, and protein-rich snacks</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Choose your Herbalife<sup>®</sup> shakes, choose your colorful meals and choose your protein-rich snacks &#8211; it’s that simple!</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>STEP 1 &#8211; MEAL PLAN SELECTION TOOL</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/MEAL-PLAN-SELECTION-TOOL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download Step 1</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">No two people are alike and everyone’s protein and calorie needs vary. So how do you know which meal plan is right for you? You’ll start with Step 1: the Meal Plan Selection Tools for Women and Men. The charts will help you quickly determine the suggested meal plan for you, and your plan is designed to match your individual needs for protein and calories.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Meal Plan Selection Tool will guide you to the recommended Meal Plan based on your gender, weight and height. Once you know which plan is recommended for you, you’ll go to Step 2 to see your suggested plan.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>STEP 2 – MEAL PLANS A, B, C, D</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/MEAL-PLANS-A-B-C-D.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download Step 2</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Once you know which plan to follow, you’ll notice that each plan has three options: Daily Nutrition, Weight Loss and Weight Gain. Choose the option within the plan that best suits your personal goals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This Meal Plan chart shows you what a typical day will look like. You can clearly see the recommended Formula 1 shakes, meals and snacks you will choose each day, depending on your plan.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Personalized daily Meal Plans are created by choosing items from the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Herbalife<sup>®</sup> Formula 1 Shakes (20-30 grams protein, 250-300 calories, depending on your plan)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Balanced Meals (25-40 grams protein, 400-600 calories, depending on your plan)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Protein Snacks (10-30 grams protein, 150-300 calories, depending on your plan)</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If your goal is to <strong><em>maintain your weight</em></strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">, follow the </span><strong>Daily Nutrition</strong><span style="font-weight: 300;"> option of your recommended Meal Plan. This option will deliver the recommended amount of protein and calories to help you maintain your weight, when coupled with an appropriate exercise program. This option replaces one meal per day (typically breakfast) with an Herbalife</span><sup style="font-weight: 300;">®</sup><span style="font-weight: 300;"> Formula 1 shake.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If you desire <strong><em>weight loss</em></strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">, follow the </span><strong>Weight Loss</strong><span style="font-weight: 300;"> option of your recommended meal plan. The Weight Loss option will deliver the recommended amount of protein, but with fewer calories, to promote weight and fat loss, when coupled with an appropriate exercise program. This option replaces two meals per day (typically lunch and dinner) with an Herbalife</span><sup style="font-weight: 300;">®</sup><span style="font-weight: 300;"> Formula 1 shake.</span></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">If your goal is to <strong><em>gain weight</em></strong><span style="font-weight: 300;">, follow the </span><strong>Weight Gain</strong><span style="font-weight: 300;"> option of your recommended meal plan. The Weight Gain option will deliver more protein and calories which, when coupled with an appropriate exercise program, will help you to gain healthy weight (as lean body mass). In the Weight Gain option, you will supplement the Daily Nutrition plan with additional Herbalife</span><sup style="font-weight: 300;">®</sup><span style="font-weight: 300;"> Formula 1 shakes, up to a total of three shakes per day.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;"><strong>MEAL BUILDER TOOL</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/MEAL-BUILDER-TOOL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Download Meal Builder Tool</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Meal Builder tool is a simple step-by-step approach to putting together healthy meals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Meals are made up of foods from five categories: Protein, Vegetables, Healthy Carbohydrates, Healthy Fats and Seasonings.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Depending on your Meal Plan, you will create meals that have either:</p>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Approximately 25 grams of protein and 400 calories</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Approximately 40 grams of protein and 600 calories</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Using the Meal Builder, you can easily select the right amount of protein, vegetables, healthy carbohydrates and healthy fats, which you will use to create your healthy meals.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">First, choose the column that corresponds to the meal you are going to build. Then, select the amounts of food that are listed in each food group and combine items in a variety of ways to create healthy, balanced meals.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Here are some ideas to get you started!</h2>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Large mixed green salad tossed with grilled fish, cooked beans, and olive oil and lemon dressing</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Chicken wrap sandwich: Fill a whole wheat flour tortilla with mixture of chopped veggies, grilled chicken, avocado and salsa</li>
<li style="text-align: justify;">Grilled top sirloin steak with steak sauce, roasted asparagus with garlic, tossed green salad with vinaigrette dressing, brown rice</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Gulf Coast Needs Our Help!</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On Sunday Hurricane Harvey, now a tropical storm, shook the Texas coast with torrential rains causing catastrophic floods, according to the National Hurricane Center.</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Here are three important reasons for you to pick up some weights and make yourself stronger. It’s a fact: strong is in. A toned, muscular and functional body has become the new sexy for both men and women. The growing acceptance by the media and sportswear companies that beauty comes in many shapes and sizes is a positive step toward encouraging people to lead a healthy, active lifestyle.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-4280" src="http://www.corenutri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Why-Strong-Is-the-New-Sexy-1024x611.png" alt="Why Strong Is the New Sexy" width="590" height="352" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Why-Strong-Is-the-New-Sexy-1024x611.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Why-Strong-Is-the-New-Sexy-300x179.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Why-Strong-Is-the-New-Sexy-768x458.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Why-Strong-Is-the-New-Sexy.png 1120w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Best of all, a healthy body, which may come in different shapes and sizes, will never go out of fashion. Have you heard of the term ‘skinny fat’? This is when someone may look thin, but in actuality they have an unhealthy internal body-fat ratio that is detrimental to their health. There are also many people who may look a little larger, but are actually very health internally. With any exercise plan, your main priority should be to benefit the inside of your body. But as a bonus, exercise benefits your external appearance as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following are important reasons why you should add weight and strength training to your regular fitness routine.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Three Reasons to Get Stronger Now</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Burn More Calories</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">By lifting weights and becoming strong, you’ll change every aspect of your body. People with increased muscle mass burn more calories at rest than those without. It takes more energy for your body to sustain lean muscle and, therefore, your resting metabolic rate may increase as a result of lifting weights.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Improved Bone Density</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Weight-bearing exercise is very beneficial for bone health in people of all ages. The aging process is linked to a decrease in bone density and a greater risk of fractures. So, consider how you can add weights to your workout, because your bones rely on resistance training to stay healthy and strong.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Improved Performance</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If your body gets used to lifting weights, imagine how much easier just lifting your own body weight will be. Improved strength means that your daily activities will become easier, and if you’re training for a sport, an increase in muscular strength can significantly improve your performance.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Becoming stronger has so many benefits, and you don’t need to be worried about looking like an out-of-proportion body builder. Unless you’re dedicating hundreds of hours to lifting heavy weights and following a very specific body-building nutrition plan, the chances of you getting bulky are slim. Adding weight training to your routine two to three times a week and eating a protein-rich diet will have you well on your way toward achieving a healthy muscular physique. Also, don’t be afraid to lift heavy weights. But do make sure that you start out with manageable, lighter weights so that you can focus on technique for 12-15 reps and slowly work your way up to heavier weights. As you increase the weight you’re using, decrease to 8-10 reps.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Your body will start adapting to weight training right away, so get started today.</p>

	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">Answer quickly … what is caffeine used for?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4275 size-large" src="http://www.corenutri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Making-Room-in-Your-Diet-for-Caffeine-1024x671.png" alt="what is caffeine used for?" width="590" height="387" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Making-Room-in-Your-Diet-for-Caffeine-1024x671.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Making-Room-in-Your-Diet-for-Caffeine-300x196.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Making-Room-in-Your-Diet-for-Caffeine-768x503.png 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Making-Room-in-Your-Diet-for-Caffeine.png 1130w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></p>
<h2 class="p1"><b>Making Room in Your Diet for Caffeine</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">More than likely, the answer was something along the lines of “getting me out of bed in the morning.” It’s normal for most people to start their day with a cup of coffee or tea, two very common sources of caffeine. Some people turn to energy drinks for a midday jolt of caffeine to get them through the afternoon. Students often use coffee to stay awake longer to study for exams. Others might like a cup of tea after a big meal to combat sleepiness. For most of us, this energy boost is why we use caffeine.</p>
<p>What a lot of people don’t realize is that there are other ways to incorporate caffeine into a healthy diet. The quick stimulant benefit of caffeine is only part of the story. In addition to a feeling of energy, caffeine stimulation brings with it thermogenic benefits.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;">Thermogenesis</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thermogenesis is a process our bodies use to produce heat, and this process requires calories. When you consume caffeine in the proper quantities, it can assist this process and create a temporary boost to your metabolism, helping you burn a few more calories.</p>
<p>Caffeine also works upon your nervous system directly, causing heightened alertness. This stimulation may also cause an increased ability to focus, although this benefit has been studied in young adults and is not certain for all consumers. A little bit of caffeine before visiting the gym or aerobic dance class may make these types of exercise seem easier to some people.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You can find caffeine in a number of coffee beverages of course, and in foods like chocolate. And because caffeine may boost metabolism and help with exercise, many dietary supplements also contain caffeine.</p>
<p>Both green and black tea contain caffeine. Tea can also supply antioxidant botanical subcomponents, making it a great way to get a dose of caffeine.<br />
Of course, like anything else, the rule of moderation applies. Pay attention to your body’s reaction to caffeine, for tolerances can vary from person to person. Be aware of the possible, unpleasant side effects that come with too much caffeine, and adjust your intake accordingly.<br />
Generally speaking, for normal, healthy individuals without a caffeine tolerance concern, a good intake is at or under 300 mg a day, which works out to roughly three cups of regular coffee. This allows you to still get the benefits of caffeine while avoiding that jittery, overcaffeinated feeling.<br />
There is a place for caffeine in your diet and it’s important to find that place and enjoy the benefits that can come with it.<br />
